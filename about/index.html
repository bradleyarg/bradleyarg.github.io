	<h1>Hi there, I'm Bradley M. Argauer!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to me! I'm a space nerd by heart but I'm curious about any and all topics and love learning everything I can. So if you're interested in space or public transportation, college football, 
constitutional law, or anything in between you should reach out. I'd love to build up a raport just like I love building anything else; communities, leadeship, and furniture included.
